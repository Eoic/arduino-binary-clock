# Arduino binary clock
Code for binary clock controlled by Arduino board. Clock display consists of two rows of leds which represents a binary number respectively for hours (4 bits) and minutes (6 bits) in 12 hour format. Example diagram below shows the binary clock, where figures labeled with numbers represents leds, of which red ones are turned on. The time shown in the diagram is 10:29.
